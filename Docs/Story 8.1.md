Story 8.1: The Template Library & Duration UI

Status: Draft

Story

As a User

I want to choose a specific video style AND a target duration (10s or 30s)

so that the generated script perfectly matches my platform strategy (Viral Hook vs. Storytelling)

Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

Step 0 Integration: A new "Creative Strategy" step added to the Wizard (before Input).

Style Selection: Grid of cards for the 5 styles (UGC, Green Screen, PAS, ASMR, Before/After).

Duration Selector: A prominent Toggle or Radio Group for "10s (Viral Hook)" vs "30s (Storytelling)". Default: 30s.

Visual Feedback: Changing the duration updates the description on the Style Cards (e.g., "UGC 10s" might say "Stop the scroll instantly" vs "Build trust").

State Persistence: Both style and duration are stored in useWizardStore.

Dev Technical Guidance

UX: The 10s option is for "Hooks/Shorts", 30s is for "Ads/Reels". Make this clear in the UI copy.
